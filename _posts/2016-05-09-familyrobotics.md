  In the photo I play with The nursery robots in the Finnish Robotics seminar
  2013.            I have always been keen on Robotics. I guess that the fact my
  both parents were physics teachers have something to do with
  it.                                 And the comic strip
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jetsons Was very popular when I was a child.
  Still we haven’t got many own robots. We used to two Nabaztag –robots. In the
  photo one of our Nabaztag named Nabkron.
